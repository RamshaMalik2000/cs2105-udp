# CS2105 
 In this assignment, a file will be transferred over UDP protocol on top of an unreliable channel that may either corrupt or drop packets randomly (but always deliver packets in order).

## Checkpoints
 | Marks | Comment | Status |
 | ----- | :-----: | :----: |
 | 2 pts | Programs compile on **sunfire** without error; program execution follows specified Java commands exactly (see sections below). In addition, submit Java programs only. The files **are not zipped, tarred, or hidden** somewhere in a folder and have the correct (file and class) names. | âœ“ |
 | 1 pt  | Programs can successfully send a small file (a few KB) from Alice to Bob in a perfectly reliable channel (i.e. no error at all). |   |
